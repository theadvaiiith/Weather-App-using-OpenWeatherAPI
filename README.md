1. Imports
tkinter as tk: Imports the Tkinter library for creating GUI applications.
from tkinter import messagebox: Imports a module to display error messages.
import requests: Imports the Requests library to make HTTP requests.
2. WeatherApp Class
__init__() method: Initializes the application. It sets the API key, creates the main window, and calls a method to set up the user interface (UI).

setup_ui() method: Constructs the UI elements:

A label prompting the user to enter a city.
An entry field for the city name.
A button that, when clicked, calls the get_weather() method.
A label to display weather information.
get_weather() method:

Retrieves the city name from the entry field.
If a city name is provided, it calls fetch_weather() to get the weather data.
Updates the weather information label with the fetched data or shows an error message if fetching fails or if no city name is entered.
fetch_weather(city) method:

Constructs the request URL using the provided city name and API key.
Sends a GET request to the OpenWeather API.
If the request is successful (HTTP status code 200), it extracts and formats the weather data (city name, temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed) and returns it.
If unsuccessful, it returns None.
3. Main Entry Point
The last part checks if the module is being run directly and creates an instance of the WeatherApp class to start the application.
Usage
Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with a valid OpenWeather API key to successfully fetch weather data. The user can run the application, enter a city name, and see the current weather information displayed in the GUI.
